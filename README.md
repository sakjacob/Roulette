The Project:
This project brings roulette to life on arduino by mimicking the popular game with LEDs. For those who don't know what roulette is, is a popular casino game where a ball circles around a bowl until it falls into a slot with an associated number. This project mimics the movement of the fall by flashing LEDs with regressing frequency until the "ball" stops in a random location.

Uses:
This project can be used for a number of instances, such as picking who gets what chores in a house shared by college students or just as a random turn picker in general.

Motivation:
My motivation behind this project was to learn how to work with hardware better as well as gain experience with random number generators, which is difficult on embedded systems.

Future plans:
Some future improvements planned for this project include creating a protective case, integrating a mobile power source, and improving the quality of the random number generator.
